==========

`atom-jsfmt` is a [`jsfmt`][jsfmt] plugin for the Atom text editor. It's pretty nifty.

Features
--------
 - **Format command**: Run the `Jsfmt: Format` command to keep your code tidy.
 - **Format on Save**: `atom-jsfmt` will auto-format your javascript on save.

Installation
------------

Make sure you have `jsfmt` installed, and then just install `atom-jsfmt` as you would any other package.

```bash
npm install -g jsfmt
apm install atom-jsfmt
# Or search for / install atom-jsfmt in Atom's package browser
```
If you have `jsfmt` installed in a location other than `/usr/local/bin/jsfmt`, be sure to set this location in the
`atom-jsfmt` preferences (under "Path To Jsfmt").

Options
-------

 - **Path To Jsfmt**: This is the path to the `jsfmt` binary. Defaults to `/usr/local/bin/jsfmt`.
   Note that binaries on your `$PATH` [may not currently be accessible to Atom][env].
 - **Show Errors**: Whether or not you want to see error messages. You probably do.
   This is set to `true` by default.
 - **Format On Save**: Whether or not you automatically want to format your javascript
   files when you save. Defaults to `true`.



To do
-----

 - Allow for input of custom rules
 - Add searching functionality
 - Flag lines with errors
 - Add a "Format project" command
 - Test / fix issues with react editor
